The party was a celebration of Adire fabric, a traditional Nigerian textile, and an opportunity to learn about proper etiquette and manners.\r\nOur school was beautifully decorated with Adire fabrics that added a touch of elegance to the atmosphere. We served a selection of high-quality tea, including black, green, and herbal teas, along with delicious snacks and bread.\r\nThe highlight of the party was the Adire fabric showcase, where our kids shared their own Adire fabrics and the stories behind them. It was inspiring to see how this traditional fabric has been passed down through generations and how it continues to be a source of pride and creativity.\r\nTruly Exceptionally Different.\r\n#TGIF\r\nWould you like to join our school community?\r\nThen visit us @\r\nüèöOur Lady Of Hope Montessori (Emerald Centre)\r\n131A&B 2nd East Circular Road Benin City. \r\n‚òéÔ∏è 08134082834\r\n  09154793693\r\n  08151707292\r\nüèöOur Lady Of Hope Montessori School(Topaz Centre)\r\n41 Agbonwonba street off MMWAY,Benin City.\r\n‚òéÔ∏è 08140974206\r\n  09154793691\r\n  08151707292\r\nWe look forward to having your child/ward join us.\r\nRemember ,this is your school UNUSUAL!!!\r\n.",

Children can play games like pin the tail on the donkey or musical chairs, and participate in activities like making crafts or decorating cupcakes. The party can be held at the school or at a community center, and parents or teachers usually organize it. It's a great opportunity for kids to relax, socialize with their classmates, and have fun before the summer break.",
